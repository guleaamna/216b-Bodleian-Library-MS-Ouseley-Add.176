    "description":"You may have heard of Shakespeare's timeless works, or Homer's Iliad, but you may be less familiar with their Persian equal (some would even say, superior), the Shahnama. The \"Book of Kings\" is a treasured piece of Persian literature written by Iranian poet Firdawsi during the 10th century CE. It reflects the history of Iran, from the beginning of the world -- as can be seen in the story of Gayrumars -- up until the loss of Persian independence to the Arab conquest in the 7th century CE (Farhat-Holzman, 2001, 3). As an epic poem, the Shahnama calls back to the rich history of passing down heroic tales through the generations by word of mouth alone, for there had been no real need of written language until the rapid expansion of the Persian empire in the 6th century CE (Farhat-Holzman, 2001, 2).\n\nOur particular manuscript is one of the three elaborately illustrated copies of the Shahnama, made for the three grandsons of the House of Timur -- Baysunghur, Muhammad Juki, and Ibrahim Sultan. This copy of the manuscript was dedicated to Ibrahim Sultan, believed to originate in Shiraz, Iran, between 1420 and 1440, during which he ruled over the area as governor (Sims, 1992, 6).\n\nThis manuscript is now held in the Bodleian Library in Oxford University, England. The digital copy of this manuscript is available as public domain on the library's website, so anyone (with access to good internet service) may experience Firdawsi's Shahnama in both its vivid poetic verse and elaborate illustrations. It is from here that I have retrieved the given image, folio 216b, illustrating an episode called \"Kay Khusrow kills Aila\"."},

    "description":"This folio depicts an intense battle. Two hosts of soldiers taking up arms against each other, one partially hidden behind a hill, the other somewhat obscured by a large cloud of dust left by charging horses. At the centre of the image is a man dressed in dark clothing with elaborate golden designs. This gives the effect of elevated status and wealth, as the golden design seems to blossom over his chest and shoulders like an enchanted flower. Here, it functions like a crown would, marking Kay Khusrow, Shah of Iran. This also stays true to the text, which places the Shah at the centre of the battle.\n\nBefore we dive deeper into the image, however, we must first briefly discuss the question itching everyone's mind: how did we get there?\n\nThe event of this folio is a continuation of the much anticipated Great War between Kay Khusrow of Iran, and Afrasiyab of Turan (his maternal grandfather), as Kay Khusrow pledge vengeance on Afrasiyab for his father's murder. Shida, son of Afrasiyab, dies to Kay Khusrow in one-on-one combat, and the Turan leader and his soldiers, all overcome with grief and vengeance, meet Kay Khusrow and his Iranian army on the battlefield. It is after this that the episode of \"Kay Khusrow kills Aila\" takes place, where a fierce, bloody battle ensues for days on end."}
